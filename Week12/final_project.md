# Learn More Series – Final Project Development Document

## Concept / Theme Write-up

This website is a themed exploration of cutting-edge technologies that challenge our current understanding of humanity and biology. The three focus areas are:

- **Bioprinting**: The ability to 3D-print human tissue and organs.
- **Genome Editing**: Techniques like CRISPR that allow us to rewrite our DNA.
- **Cybernetics**: The merging of man and machine.

Each topic is presented in its own dedicated section with educational content, ethical dilemmas, and interactive options like voting and user feedback. The overarching theme is *"Where science meets identity and ethics"*, encouraging users to think critically about how far technology should go.
