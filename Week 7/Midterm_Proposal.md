# Midterm proposal 

Concept/Theme:
"A Visual Timeline of Futuristic Tech in biotechnology" – As a bioengineering major I thought that a website showcasing key technological advancements predicted for the next few decades within the field of biology and medicine would be interesting. Each section represents a different year with interactive elements and smooth transitions.


## Inspirations 

https://www.apple.com - for aesthetics 

https://timeline.knightlab.com - for interactivity and layout

## Skills I will use

- this is what I would like the aesthetic to be, merged with the apple timeline. 

- I am thinking of bringing up contreversial innovations, such as stem cell technology which can imply immortality. Perhaps this website could stem out to more bioethical questions?
