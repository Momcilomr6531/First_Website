## The box model 

* block and in-line are the two main behaviours

* you can choose block by using '.block {display: inline;}

* The box models affect all visual contents on the website

## box properties 

* content - where the content is displayed 

* padding - content as white space 

* border - wraps around the content 

* margin - is the outermost layer

* when we use span> it creates another block within a block. 

* you can give different things the same properties in css by just listing them before
