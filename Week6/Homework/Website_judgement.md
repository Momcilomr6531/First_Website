## Websites I found nice : 
* https://www.netflix.com/browse

netflix is nice obviously, I like its menus especially and the minimalism of it. 

* https://www.premierleague.com

The premierleague has a very elaborate website from which I can draw a lot of inspiration from 

* https://www.skyscanner.ae

This website reminds you that your page can do everything it needs to while being simple and aesthetic 

## Websites which are less appealing: 

This is more difficult, since I don't really surf the web much and I am more mainstream when it comes to my websites. 

But I want to try find some random sites which might show me what not to do.

There is a site called the useless web, which takes you to a random site.

So I will be using this and judging sites. 

*https://maze.toys/mazes/mighty/daily/

This is a pretty boring page, however, it goes to show how far user interactivity can go to retain interest. However the colours and theme are not engaging or aesthetic. 

* https://paint.toys/calligram/

This site really intrigued me. For such an interesting idea which must take a lot of time and effort to pull off, it was quite underwhelming. I guess at the end of the day, if your page doesn't offer anything interesting or satisfying, it will be left out to dry.
