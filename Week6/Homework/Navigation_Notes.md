## Navigation notes 


* every website has some form of a navigation bar

* with CSS we can transform the type of navigation

* to remove bullets from links, you can use 'list-style-type' and set it to none. 

* e.g. li { list-stlye-type : none;}

* you can use li { display: inline;} - recommended !

## horizontal navigation bar example

* li {display: inline;}

* li a { display: block; padding: 8px; backgroud - color: pink}

* ul { list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;
overflow: hidden; 
background-colour: pink;}

## naming 

* very important if you dont want everything in your html file to have the same properties


## use the class = "active"

you can name anything such as active and then assign its class to change its properties.
